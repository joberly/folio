Photography portfolio site server and generator utilities.

## Introduction

Many times popular services and website templates tend to clutter photography and videography portfolio sites with overly busy headers, footers, navigation bars, and other UI elements. These elements tend to detract from the aesthetic of the media presentation. Folio intends to present porfolios with less distraction with a more minimalistic art style.
